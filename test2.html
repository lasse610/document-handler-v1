  <strong>The giraffe</strong
  ><span>
    is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the
    tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
    Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa
    camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed
    dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their
    mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven
